# ‚ù± Plex Assistant

Plex Assistant is a component to allow Google Assistant to cast Plex media to Google devices and Plex clients with a bit of help from IFTTT or DialogFlow. You could also use this component with anything that can make a service call to HA (see the IFTTT and DialogFlow automations in the readme as a starting point).

Example: `"Hey Google, tell Plex to play The Walking Dead on the Downstairs TV."`

You can use the component's service without IFTTT/DialogFlow to call the commands however you'd like. Visit the services tab in HA's Developer Tools to test it out.

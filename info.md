# ‚ù± Plex Assistant

Plex Assistant is a Home Assistant Component to allow Google Assistant to cast Plex to Chromecasts with a bit of help from [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

This component adds a service to Home Assistant that when called with IFTTT on a Google Assistant will take commands to cast Plex to a Chromecast/Google Home/Google Nest device.

Example: `"Hey Google, tell Plex to play The Walking Dead on the Downstairs TV."`

You can use the component's service without IFTTT as well to call the commands however you'd like.
